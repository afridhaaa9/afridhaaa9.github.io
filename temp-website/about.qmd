## Project Background

In my final year at Temasek Polytechnic, I undertook a challenging and innovative project titled "Smart Health Monitoring System." This project was part of my coursework in Computer Science and aimed to develop a wearable device that could monitor vital health metrics in real-time.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the Smart Health Monitoring System were to:
- Develop a reliable system for tracking vital health metrics such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure.
- Integrate real-time data analysis to provide immediate feedback and alerts to the user.
- Enhance user engagement with health monitoring through a user-friendly mobile application.

## Challenges Faced

During the project, I encountered several significant challenges:
- **Sensor Integration:** Ensuring accurate and reliable sensor readings in different environmental conditions.
- **Data Security:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive health data.
- **User Interface Design:** Creating an intuitive interface that could be easily navigated by users of all ages.

## Solutions and Technologies Used

To overcome these challenges, my team and I employed several strategies and technologies:
- **Arduino and Raspberry Pi:** Used for gathering data from sensors and processing it in real-time.
- **Flutter:** Developed the mobile application to interface with the hardware using Flutter, which allowed for a cross-platform, responsive app design.
- **AES Encryption:** Implemented AES encryption for secure data transmission between the device and the app.

## Project Outcomes

The project was a success, culminating in:
- A fully functional prototype that was tested with a small group of users, receiving positive feedback on its accuracy and ease of use.
- An academic paper submitted to a national conference on wearable technology, which discussed our findings and methodologies.

## Skills Developed

This project helped me develop a range of skills, including:
- **Technical Skills:** Advanced programming in Python and Dart, hardware integration, and data security implementation.
- **Soft Skills:** Project management, teamwork, and problem-solving under pressure.

## Reflection

Reflecting on this experience, I gained not only technical knowledge but also valuable lessons in teamwork and innovation. This project was instrumental in shaping my career aspirations and prepared me well for advanced studies and professional challenges at SIT.
