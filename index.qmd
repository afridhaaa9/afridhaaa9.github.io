The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is Singapore’s first University of Applied Learning and the third largest university by intake in Singapore. SIT’s mission is to maximise the potential of our learners and to innovate with industry, through an integrated applied learning and research approach, so as to contribute to the economy and society.
<br><br>
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Applied Computing with a specialization in Financial Technology at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). This three-year direct honours programme is designed in collaboration with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It equips students with crucial skills in computing and finance, preparing them for dynamic roles in the fintech sector.
<br><br>
The curriculum includes training in software engineering, applied computing, and machine learning, tailored to meet the needs of the financial industry, covering areas like banking compliance and financial products management. A unique feature of the programme is the Term-In Term-Out (TITO) model, which integrates 16 months of industry work attachments spread over the duration of the course, providing substantial practical experience alongside theoretical learning.
